# Machine-Learning---Linear-Regression
I created a machine learning model using linear regression to predict per capita income in a country in various years.

The second which is a multiple linear regression was created to predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience, test scores and interview scores. I filled the missing values, i calculated with the median for the test scores column which was missing in row 7. i was torn between calculating with the mean or median value but i used the median since it was a small dataset
